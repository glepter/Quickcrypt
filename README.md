# Quickcrypt
Script for quick encription of files

Generaring a key file will save a randomly-generated key to encrypt the data with, after the file is encrypted it will require the SAME key to be decrypted, using a different key to decrypt the data will corrupt the data and the original key won't work to decrypt it anymore. 

**WARNING!** 
Lossing the original key or encrypting/decrypting twice in a row may result in unrecoverable data, use it under own risk, the idea behind it is "I'd rather lose this info than have it stolen"
